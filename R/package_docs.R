#' A package to analyze survey data of Norwegians' understanding of IHC concepts
#' 
#' @note Installing this package may generate numerous messages, some of which
#'   are reported to be errors. These messages indicate how columns in imported
#'   data are being parsed; indicate parsing errors in columns not used in 
#'   the analyses; and note that the `exp` function is called without arguments
#'   when used in `magrittr` pipelines. You can safely ignore these messages.
